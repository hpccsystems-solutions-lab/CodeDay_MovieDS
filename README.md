# CodeDay - Big Data Challenge

HPCC Systems Solutions Lab is proud to collaborate with [CodeDay Org](https://www.codeday.org/) on Big Data Challenge.

Through the Big Data Challenge students are introduced to big data concepts, they become familiar with ECL (Enterprise Control Language) our big data programming language)=, and they get hands-on practice. During the challenge, students are given sample ECL code and an opportunity to solve challenge questions ranging from easy to mid-level difficulty.

# Challenge

For this challenge students will work with "Movie Dataset".

Data and initial code for the challenge can be found at [CodeDay Workshop](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/workspaces/share/2d39925a-2abc-407d-a849-2b39c39bb1ad)
- getMovies: Give you access to dataset, it's layout, and fields name.
- viewMovies: Let's you view the movie data.
 - Start a new script with : IMPORT $.getMovies;
